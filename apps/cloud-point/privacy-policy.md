_Last updated: September 2025_

Cloud Point respects your privacy. This page explains what data is (and isn‚Äôt) collected, how it‚Äôs used, and your rights as a user.

---

## Information We Collect

**Information You Provide**
- Email Addresses: We collect the email addresses you provide when creating an account or contacting us for support.
- Photos: The App allows users to upload photos. These photos are stored securely via Firebase and used solely for the purpose of providing the services within the App. They are sent via Google's Gemini API for image interpretation which has it's own privacy policy. Only images of clouds should be uploaded (with no personal idenitifers of any kind present).
- Location (_optional_): You have the option of saving the approximate location (coordinates are rounded) of images uploaded to the app. This will then be visible on the community maps page.
- Usernames: Upon signing up to the app, you will be asked to create a username that is publicly visible on the community pages if you upload a post. This can be changed later.
- Profile Photo: You have the option of uploading a photo to act as your community visible profile photo. This can be changed later.

**Automatically Collected Information**
- Usage Information: We may collect information about your interaction with the App, such as the features you use and how often you use them. This also involves diagnostics and crash reports.
- Device Information: We do collect information about your device, including the device type (eg iPhone 13), but NOT operating system version or unique device identifiers.
- This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.

**Crash reports**  
- If the app crashes, anonymized crash information may be collected through Apple‚Äôs system to help diagnose and fix issues.

## How Your Information Is Used

- To provide the core functionality of Cloud Point (cloud identification and explanations).  
- To improve reliability, performance, and future features.

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal information with advertisers or third parties.

---
## Data Retention

We will retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Data you upload to your account is stored only so long as your account is active - this is generally 12 months of not logging in.

- **Apple App Store** (for distribution, in-app purchases, and analytics)
